Over the course of my trialling with my stakeholders for my sprint one design, I have gotten mostly constructive criticism which allowed me to make slight improvements from the initial prototype design. This information is gathered via a forum prompting questions for my stakeholders. This will therefore give me the feedback I need to improve my design to fit the needs of my audience fulfilling my intended purpose of making a satisfactory interface.

### 1️⃣ Stakeholder One (Opeloge)

* __Request(s)__

My first stakeholder had requested for my next interaction to incorporate a quote on quote "better Aesthetics". I have to assume from this lacklustre amount of feedback that the stakeholder is requesting that I make the tkinter GUI more exciting through the use of: dynamic colours, visual indicators(winning and lose conditions), symmetrical 3x3 box based game grid. Furthermore I plan to integrate this request since I find it plausible for my digital outcome's intended purpose and appeal.

### 2️⃣ Stakeholder Two (Astyn)

* __Request(s)__

For my second stakeholder, they have requested that I incorporate a unique function being the player vs ai. Since they request for more diversity and single player availability allowing those that want to verse a seperate opposition rather than having to gain their friends just to play a game. Furthermore I decide that I will incorporate this stakeholder request since it follows the intent to allow fluent player usability for my robust programme.

### 3️⃣ Stakeholder Three (Zane)

* __Request(s)__

For my third stakeholder they have requested in terms of my digital outcome that I should also take into regards of my design choices. In particular they would like it if I resized the 3x3 game widgets to make it mose consistent with the conventional design. Therefore I intend to comply with this request since being conventional to the stakeholder's ideals of what they expect of the digital outcome will further convey that this programme is a representation of the iconic tic tac toe game.

Over the course of my trialling with my stakeholders for my sprint two design, I have received some constructive criticism which allowed me to make improvements for the previous second prototype design. This information is gathered via a forum which will therefore give me the feedback I need to improve my design to fit the needs of my audience.

I have managed to complete my program for this is my final product. There will be final feedback for my last design in which I will analyse for possible integration and ways that I could improve the program if I were to work on this continuously for a longer duration of time.
