Over the course of my trialling with my stakeholders for my sprint one design, I have gotten mostly constructive criticism which allowed me to make slight improvements from the initial prototype design. This information is gathered via a forum prompting questions for my stakeholders. This will therefore give me the feedback I need to improve my design to fit the needs of my audience fulfilling my intended purpose of making a satisfactory interface.

### 1️⃣ Stakeholder One (Opeloge)

* __Request(s)__

My first stakeholder had requested for my next interaction to incorporate a quote on quote "better Aesthetics". I have to assume from this lacklustre amount of feedback that the stakeholder is requesting that I make the tkinter GUI more exciting through the use of: dynamic colours, visual indicators(winning and lose conditions), symmetrical 3x3 box based game grid. Furthermore I plan to integrate this request since I find it plausible for my digital outcome's intended purpose and appeal

* __Integration__

>Throughout the process of my sprint two, I have successfully met the requirements of my first stakeholder. I have provided the integration of the status and priority combo boxes that allow the user to customise their tasks according to what they are doing for the task and how important it is to them. I have also filled up the empty space with the other widgets that I had intended initially. I have added, due date and modified task capabilities for the user to add specifications to each task in the task manager.

### 2️⃣ Stakeholder Two (Astyn)

* __Request(s)__

My second stakeholder had requested that I incorporate a logo for my next design. I have decided to dismiss this request for I am already planning to do such an improvement in the following sprint 3. This is because I have organised all the style based and theme based tasks that must be done around the last sprint due to it being the final touches of the application. 

* __Integration__

>Throughout the creation of sprint 3, I have managed to implement the logo that my second stakeholder requested. This logo has a unique design which also replicates the black and blue style that I was going towards for my programme. I have successfully met the requirements of my second stakeholder.

### 3️⃣ Stakeholder Four (Zane)

Overall, the feedback given by my third stakeholder was not constructive whatsoever and lacked to provide any criticism towards my program. Furthermore leading me clueless on what I should improve.

## ⛓️ Sprint Two → Sprint Three

__Sprint Three Design__  
<img src="../assets\markdown-images\Trial_Notes_Images\Sprint_Outcomes\Sprint_3_Outcome.png" alt="Sprint 3 Outcome" width="650"/>

Over the course of my trialling with my stakeholders for my sprint two design, I have received some constructive criticism which allowed me to make improvements for the previous second prototype design. This information is gathered via a forum which will therefore give me the feedback I need to improve my design to fit the needs of my audience.

### 1️⃣ Stakeholder One (Nathan)

* __Request(s)__

According to my first stakeholder, they would want me to add a combination of things to my program. These requirements being:

1️⃣ - Add a scrollbar to indicate that the table can display tasks beyond the size of the treeview table

2️⃣ - Ensure that the date system is more accurate to 365 day year system

3️⃣ - Improve the style of the application with different colours

4️⃣ - Increase the due date period from 2100 to more

I intend to incorporate all of these requests since I have already intended to add a scrollbar and styles to the application. I can provide the stakeholder's requirements of minor tweaks for certain functions.

* __Integration__

>According to the first part of my first stakeholder's request, I have successfully added a scrollbar on the right hand side for the user to view as many tasks as they make. I have also incorporated a more accurate due date system only allowing certain days to be available when a certain date is chosen. I have improved the overall design via the black and blue windows 11 theme. I have also increased the max year range from 2100-3000.

### 2️⃣ Stakeholder Two (Ope)

According to my second stakeholder, they have given me the liberty of giving me no constructive feedback. This limits my ability to comprehend what the user wants and what they think would be optimal to change for the design and functionality for their perspective. Ultimately making them useless for any feedback for this sprint.

### 3️⃣ Stakeholder Three (Astyn)

* __Request(s)__

According to my third stakeholder, they have requested that I incorporate a system where the date due widget is optional rather than required. I intend to incorporate this requirement since it would not harm the functionality of the program and will fulfill the wishes of the users.

* __Integration__

>Regarding the request that was made by my third stakeholder, I have managed to implicate an optional due date system. As highlighted in red, I have ensured that the user is able to neglect the due date property and thus will leave it blank as shown in the date due column.

### 4️⃣ Stakeholder Four (Steven)

* __Request(s)__

According to my fourth stakeholder based on my new design, they have requested that I make my task manager look more unique and different compared to your generic task manager made by many other companies. They would want me to make my program have its own designs that make it unique in comparison to others. I intend to incorporate their request by adding my own, personally designed logo for my program accompanied with a new style to go with it. These features will furthermore give my program a new look making it more clean and profound to the modern era. This makes it unique with its own use of style and labeling in my name.

>I have managed to incorporate the changes that my fourth stakeholder has requested. I may have said previously, I have made a clean blue and black theme that enhances my design of my application. I have also made a unique logo for my application that gives its own unique presence from other task manager applications and other companies.

### 5️⃣ Stakeholder Five (Zane)

* __Request(s)__

According to my fifth stakeholder, they have requested that I incorporate the use of making a sorting system. This will order the tasks accordingly depending on the information of the task. I furthermore decide to object to this requirement for I have stated previously that I do not intend to add this initially thought of feature. It will end up taking me too much time to incorporate in which I do not have, and is furthermore a mild feature that I believe the user will not use.

## ✨ Sprint Three → Beyond

__Sprint Three Design__  
<img src="../assets\markdown-images\Trial_Notes_Images\Sprint_Outcomes\Sprint_3_Outcome.png" alt="Sprint 3 Outcome" width="650"/>

I have managed to complete my program for this is my final product. There will be final feedback for my last design in which I will analyse for possible integration and ways that I could improve the program if I were to work on this continuously for a longer duration of time.

### 1️⃣ Stakeholder One (Nathan)

* __Request(s)__

According to my first stakeholder, they have requested that I incorporate a way for the user to save their changes for prolonged use of my application. I would have integrated this using a method of data storage(txt files) that would help organise the tasks that the user has entered and save it on their corresponding device. This will continue the information for the next session of use by the user.

### 2️⃣ Stakeholder Two (Ope)

* __Request(s)__

According to my second stakeholder, they unfortunately once again have given me no constructive criticism or feedback that will allow me to improve my design if I were to continue with this project.

### 3️⃣ Stakeholder Three (Astyn)

* __Request(s)__

According to my third stakeholder, they have made a comment regarding the colour scheme of my application not meeting their preference. I would fix this issue by integrating a way for the user to change the colour scheme of the application with different theme presets. This will furthermore allow the user to make the application unique and special to their own needs.

### 4️⃣ Stakeholder Four (Steven)

* __Request(s)__

According to my fourth stakeholder, they have made a comment regarding the sizing of certain widgets like the add and remove buttons not fitting the label frame properly. I intend to fix this problem via changing the sizing of the add and remove buttons to fit in the label frame widget to make it more consistent with the design elements.

### 5️⃣ Stakeholder Five (Zane)

* __Request(s)__

According to my fifth stakeholder, they too have unfortunately given me no constructive criticism. This furthermore means they have given me nothing to improve on if I were to make another iteration of this project.
