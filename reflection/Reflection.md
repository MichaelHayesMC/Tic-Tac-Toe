Documentation regarding tools that were used for the creation and process of my final digital outcome.

## Trello Usage

### Sprint 1

As presented above I have been able to fulfil the goals that I had set for myself for my first sprint Requirements. In the first sprint I wanted to make a working prototype that would allow users to test the basic functionality of a generic tic tac toe game. Therefore by recording and managing my schedule for this sprint I was able to fulfil these requirements in an orderly fashion alongside accompanied comments inside the descriptive boxes.

### Sprint 2

## Flowcharts
### Prototype Wireframe Flowchart -> Sprint 1 Programme Flowchart

For my first design after the finalisation of stakeholder feedback, I was able to create a visual flowchart describing the process of functions for my tkinter project being the ideology of the finished digital outcomes' intended purpose. As explained by the algorithm for my pseudocode my outcome will generate the 3x3 game necessary for basic gameplay and basic score indicators for score tracking and replayability allowing for repetitive fun amongst friends and peers. The colour therefore separates the different modules of code describing their intended purpose by the title they fall under.

## Test Cases

Over the course of time I had used test cases to record the errors that were made and fixed during my game making process. Throughout the game making process I decided to record my efforts via spreadsheets describing what the test case was, what I did to perform it, and how I fixed it if it needed fixing. This makes it easier for other programmers to read my efforts to know that I went through the efforts to properly cultivate my programme for my end-users rather than making something out of AI that voids what I am trying to achieve.
